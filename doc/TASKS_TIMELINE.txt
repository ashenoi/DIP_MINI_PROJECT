Target is to implemet Algorithm 2 from the paper.
Functions to be implemented:
--> Function for generation motion vectors(MV) for a given 2 frames and a block size and search size. To be done by SAD minimization. Use Lecture-11.pdf slide 9, use SAD instead of MAD.(Use the already given calculate_SAD function)
--> Refine MV by Enegy minimization i.e select MV with the lowest Energy.  Refer to equation (19) of paper for Energy. 
--> The above function will be called repeatedly with the block size reducing by a factor of 2, till it is 1x1.
--> From the above function pass the MVs to next level. Repeat until we reach all the way to top.
--> The refined MV's will be used by the higher level by implementing Hierarchial search as mentioned in Lecture-11.pdf, slide 16/17


Also need to figure out how to use the code for processing the .flo file from the mulberry website. This will be the final part for generating results.


Doubts:
1. When we are finding MV's will we get multiple MV's for each block.
2. When the block sizes is halved, how do we take candidate set, will the half block be taken by keeping the centre constant?
